In a shocking development that has rocked the culinary world, traditional sea salt varieties are demanding equal recognition amid the continuing dominance of Himalayan Pink Salt in upscale restaurants and food photography.

## Industry Reaction

"For too long, we've been pushed to the back of the spice cabinet," declares **Mediterranean Sea Salt**, a spokesperson for the Coalition of Traditional Salts (COTS). "Just because we don't have that 'Instagram-worthy' pink hue doesn't make us any less capable of enhancing flavors."

The controversy reached a boiling point last week when several high-end restaurants were caught artificially dyeing regular sea salt pink to appease social media influencers.

> *"It's salt-washing, plain and simple,"* says Atlantic Gray, a coarse grain activist.

### Market Impact

* Himalayan Pink Salt futures dropped **3.2%** following the controversy
* Traditional sea salt variants saw a modest *1.5% rise* in wholesale prices
* Specialty salt retailers report increased interest in "authenticity certificates"

Industry experts note this could reshape the $8.2 billion global gourmet salt market. "We're seeing a fundamental shift in consumer awareness," notes Pepper Black, leading seasoning analyst at Umami & Associates. "The days of color-based discrimination in the salt market may be coming to an end."

When reached for comment, Himalayan Pink Salt representatives maintained their rosy outlook:

> "We believe there's room for all of us in the market. Our pink hue is natural, and we stand by our mineral content claims."

The movement has sparked a broader conversation about mineral diversity in the seasoning industry, with some calling for mandatory color-blind taste testing in culinary schools.
